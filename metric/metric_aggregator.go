// Aggregator implements a specific aggregation behavior, e.g., a
// behavior to track a sequence of updates to an instrument.  Sum-only
// instruments commonly use a simple Sum aggregator, but for the
// distribution instruments (ValueRecorder, ValueObserver) there are a
// number of possible aggregators with different cost and accuracy
// tradeoffs.
//
// Note that any Aggregator may be attached to any instrument--this is
// the result of the OpenTelemetry API/SDK separation.  It is possible
// to attach a Sum aggregator to a ValueRecorder instrument or a
// MinMaxSumCount aggregator to a Counter instrument.
